                    There are two basic types of scopes, both are represented with <code>ApiScope</code>
                    in the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll call the first type of scopes <em>API Scopes</em>. An API scope represents
                    a web API. It can be added to the <code>allowedScopes</code> of a client to indicate
                    that the client can access the web API. The name of the scope will be included the
                    <code>scope</code> claim of the access token, and the web API should check if the
                    user is authenticated and if the scope claim has the right value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll call the second type of scopes <em>Access Scopes</em>. An accesss scope represents
                    some access privilege such as <samp>read</samp>, <samp>write</samp>, <samp>delete</samp>,
                    and so on. We can assign access scopes together with an API scope to a client, which can
                    then be interpreted by the web API as the client only having the asssigned access privileges.
